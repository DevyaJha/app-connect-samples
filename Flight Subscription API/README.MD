## Scenario

Rob, an integration developer, configures an API flow in App Connect Designer to create a flight subscription in SAP and create a contact record in Salesforce. Rob doesn’t need any experience with SAP, only getting required SAP OData configuration details from his SAP admin. Rob exploits App Connect’s “configuration without coding” approach to create and then publish the API in a matter of minutes, and then simply provides the API invocation details to the application developer for use in the app.

When a web/mobile app calls the API, App Connect creates a subscription in SAP and creates a contact in Salesforce.
